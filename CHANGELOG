0.1.9
=====

* **New:** Added ``List.to_string()`` method to get a string representation of
  the EDL, which outputs a string matching a regular EDL (File 32) file content
  (the audio track information is still not put in to this string so it needs
  more work, the tests are failing).

* **New:** Added ``TitleMatcher`` class to match against "TITLE" value, also
  added tests for this class.

* **Fix:** Fixed ``EffectMatcher``, it is now successfully matching the effect
  value.

* **New:** Added tests for the ``EffectMatcher.apply()`` method and
  ``EffectMatcher.regex`` attribute value.

* **New:** Added ``TimeWarp.to_string()`` which outputs a EDL (File 32)
  compatible string representation of the ``Timewarp`` object.

* **New:** Added ``Event.to_string()`` which outputs a EDL (File 32) compatible
  string representation of the ``Event`` object.

* **Update:** Edited tests to reflect changes in version 0.2.0 of 
  ``pythontimecode`` library.

* **Update:** Moved the ``edl.py`` file to ``edl/__init__.py`` to fix the
  quirky library usage. So with this change instead of::

    from edl import edl
    p = edl.Parser('24')

  You can use::

    import edl
    p = edl.Parser('24')

  or::

    from edl import Parser
    p = Parser('24')
